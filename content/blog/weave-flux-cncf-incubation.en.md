It's not the news of this year but I think it is worth mentioning: [Weave Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux) just got accepted into the CNCF sandbox. We talked about Flux a little bit before in this [article]() about CI/CD pipelines.

Let's talk a little bit more about what the different level of project are in the CNCF and what it means for Flux.

### Open Source principles

Most of the biggest OSS projects today belongs to a foundation, allowing projects to keep a certain degree of independence with the original creator, be more neutral and attract more developers. These foundations also have several purposes, like marketing, promotion, brand protection (trademark logo, name etc.), event organisation. The main goal is to drive the community and the adoption.

Some well known foundations are :

- [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) originally for the linux kernel but now manages other foundations and umbrella organizations.
- [OpenStack Foundation](https://www.openstack.org/foundation/) manages OpenStack related projects and also Zuul and Kata containers for example.
- [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/) which is under the linux foundation and manages a lot of projects like Kubernetes, Prometheus, CNI, Helm and more.

### Project levels inside the CNCF

The CNCF hosts several projects, about 40 at the time, these projects are not all equal and are distributed in 3 levels:

- Graduated
- Incubating
- Sandbox

These different levels are here to show the level of maturity of each project and help user to make an informed choice

Technical Oversight Commitee is responsible to judge and decide the maturity level and allows the projects to pass to the next level. To do so, several elements are taken into account:

- Number of users
- Code stability (not exempt or bug but mostly API stability)
- Diversity of contributors (different companies)
- Respect of CNCF best practices

Only 6 projects are in the Graduated program for now !

Some specific details are available [here](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/process/graduation_criteria.adoc)

#### Flux gets into sandbox

Flux is accepted into the first level: the sandbox. This will allow the project to gain more visibility and to increase its user count which means more issues and contribution to finally increase the overall stability of the project !
